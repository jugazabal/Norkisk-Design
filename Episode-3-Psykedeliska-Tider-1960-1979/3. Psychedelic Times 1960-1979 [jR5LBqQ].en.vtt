I started collecting vintage design
25 years ago–

I never thought I would start collecting
Panton. I just bought things.

00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:34.320 align:left position:22%
Typical for Vuokko
was loose-fitting clothing–

Maija Isola was truly an artist.

00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:32.800 align:left position:22%
I see her more as an artist

Unikko has an interesting history.

00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:47.200 align:left position:22%
Marimekko's founder Armi Ratia did not want
any flowers in the collection–

00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:51.600 align:left position:22%
–because she thought
they were most beautiful in nature.

00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:57.280 align:left position:22%
But Maija Isola disagreed.

00:08:57.440 --> 00:09:03.520 align:left position:22%
So she created a whole series
of floral prints that she showed to Armi.

When talking about Unikko
and saying that it is a flower–

00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:28.000 align:left position:22%
Unikko is namely both
an abstraction and a flower.

00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:32.160 align:left position:22%
This makes Unikko a unique print.

00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:38.800 align:left position:22%

They experimented with the room–

Then they came up with the idea that furniture
could also float in the air.

She thought that children don't sit still,

00:15:03.440 --> 00:15:07.200 align:left position:22%
So it shouldn't be small adult furniture–

00:19:27.120 --> 00:19:31.760 align:left position:22%
But no one showed
any interest.

1784e4af-bc3b-4c65-9a7a-606aeb70d92a
00:19:31.920 --> 00:19:36.760 align:left position:22%
<c.teletext>But a meeting with a young Swiss man
would change his life.</c>

10f7ac6d-0bbc-438a-ae8b-f210ea93a035
00:19:38.280 --> 00:19:40.960 align:left position:22%
<c.teletext>Rolf Fehlbaum was in his 20s–</c>

00:19:41.120 --> 00:19:45.280 align:left position:22%
<c.teletext>–and on the way into
his father's design company Vitra.</c>

2da5547e-157b-46b1-8699-b3cafa9ac447
00:19:45.440 --> 00:19:49.840 align:left position:22%
He came to Basel on his father's invitation.

1da6bb75-b394-4a36-ad1a-540f725c2926
00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:53.960 align:left position:22%
I got to come along and met Verner.

e2b1befc-3e83-4b5b-9506-24564bb3f929
00:19:55.240 --> 00:19:59.640 align:left position:22%
He was a rebel, and I liked that.

f159c31c-79ad-472d-82d3-870d8903466f
00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:04.840 align:left position:22%
He was plastic, when Denmark was wood.

22fc97eb-0a58-4561-bfdd-d21c4c2dc29e
00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:12.640 align:left position:22%
He was strong colors, when typical
Danish was beautiful, discreet colors.

f77a4152-0859-4eeb-8c05-187cfc37ad48
00:20:12.800 --> 00:20:17.840 align:left position:22%
I thought it was exciting.
It was typical 1960s.

49271689-1749-420e-964e-93ccef48ed48
00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:22.240 align:left position:22%
Everything would change.
Everything would be new.

8ec4da20-3e10-40f2-b82d-9b49e0ac466e
00:20:23.840 --> 00:20:28.400 align:left position:22%
So I was interested,
and we became good friends.

d6e56493-143c-4806-9a3e-66440ac59c4f
00:20:31.880 --> 00:20:35.560 align:left position:22%
Dad was a busy man–

00:20:35.720 --> 00:20:40.640 align:left position:22%
–so the chair disappeared
from consciousness for a while.

6c9b7a44-0058-4207-a66b-42dbc16eed2d
00:20:42.280 --> 00:20:46.400 align:left position:22%
<c.teletext>What made it impossible
for Panton to produce his chair–</c>

298b7956-6b8b-44ec-8e49-92bfbe6147c5
00:20:46.560 --> 00:20:52.680 align:left position:22%
<c.teletext>–was that a special machine was needed
that was expensive to manufacture.</c>

3d23fc3a-9011-4416-8e96-031237ffa120
00:20:52.840 --> 00:20:59.360 align:left position:22%
<c.teletext>But since Vitra had made Eames chairs
in fiberglass, the technology was there.</c>

f6de5165-c19a-4509-9ad5-ce77bd53c41d
00:20:59.520 --> 00:21:02.120 align:left position:22%
<c.teletext>And eventually they said yes.</c>

586e1028-06d8-4a80-8329-4797ea4c7d4e
00:21:02.280 --> 00:21:04.720 align:left position:22%
Then it started.

3911173b-9249-4084-9872-6e7b968898a7
00:21:06.360 --> 00:21:12.320 align:left position:22%
Something from a rebellious time fits
perhaps best in another rebellious time.

7484379c-25cd-4aba-b4f2-87194905e4d9
00:21:12.480 --> 00:21:18.440 align:left position:22%
And I believe that the Panton Chair
still has the energy–

f14da8a5-2ed1-489b-8b03-14992dfc288c
00:21:18.600 --> 00:21:23.360 align:left position:22%
–from its first daring idea.

28f31862-9481-4671-99e4-0a878e29e9a3
00:21:25.440 --> 00:21:32.840 align:left position:22%
To make a chair in one piece of plastic
is still a fantastic idea.

9c8fe2be-fce2-4a90-bc00-5dc6db418cef
00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:36.360 align:left position:22%
And I believe that people still see that.

1c4e0f22-a771-4670-8d0b-1e4b5634d4d9
00:21:36.520 --> 00:21:42.400 align:left position:22%
It keeps a chair or an object alive.

18de8b24-a777-4b6b-ae31-8e7fc556b8fd
00:21:43.600 --> 00:21:49.880 align:left position:22%
For it represents still
the idea of doing something completely different.

00:21:52.360 --> 00:21:59.120 align:left position:22%
<c.teletext>We go east to another epoch-
defining designer: Yrjö Kukkapuro.</c>

8c8d0c0c-86b5-4a70-bd99-660e09ef6837
00:21:59.280 --> 00:22:03.280 align:left position:22%
<c.teletext>At the same time, he also experimented
with new materials–</c>

3cf26477-69fd-4785-8354-e426dfec1107
00:22:03.440 --> 00:22:07.400 align:left position:22%
<c.teletext>–and completely own ingenious functions.</c>

00:22:14.520 --> 00:22:18.440 align:left position:22%
The original chair had a ball bearing.

0454704b-44a0-4891-9bdc-d01c3cbd0506
00:22:21.280 --> 00:22:26.120 align:left position:22%
In that chair sat little Isa, that is, I.

b6d0841f-9a48-4c79-8e59-700fc713a554
00:22:26.280 --> 00:22:31.240 align:left position:22%
I gave it speed and shouted:
"It's like a carousel!"

134e9243-7b63-4036-b8f6-016f14bf131f
00:22:35.440 --> 00:22:39.280 align:left position:22%
So the chair got the name Carousel.

ec26a392-bc2c-4654-9fd8-c5e71e33e77f
00:22:40.760 --> 00:22:46.480 align:left position:22%
So it has been called since 1965.

00:22:50.520 --> 00:22:54.800 align:left position:22%
Yrjö Kukkapuro is a kind of legend.

13d3545d-9a90-44f6-ba4b-cb0ae5d771bd
00:22:54.960 --> 00:23:02.320 align:left position:22%
He shaped his own life and thereby
also the lives of all his loved ones.

0f50f209-b92d-46a2-a068-1bbbba01e4ad
00:23:03.600 --> 00:23:08.800 align:left position:22%
Yrjö has gained fame
as an original furniture designer.

00:23:10.160 --> 00:23:16.000 align:left position:22%
If you described your own design,
what terms would you use?

2cdcb950-5821-482a-b30b-e78cf3d8cc77
00:23:21.760 --> 00:23:27.400 align:left position:22%
Aesthetics. The aesthetic is extremely important.

b0b12135-c7c3-4a2c-b8ed-a991cff903b8
00:23:27.560 --> 00:23:34.560 align:left position:22%
In the design process, aesthetics
often becomes more important than function.

037f657d-7ddd-481c-be1c-fdf919bd21d8
00:23:36.200 --> 00:23:41.440 align:left position:22%
But to achieve
an aesthetically high-quality product–

c03eee47-f41b-43e9-aed4-257d4c49f3ad
00:23:41.600 --> 00:23:46.440 align:left position:22%
–is perhaps the hardest
with design.

9dea6397-b6c7-4ea2-a80d-ec8dae14a39c
00:23:51.080 --> 00:23:55.800 align:left position:22%
My parents wanted to build
their own studio.

00:23:55.960 --> 00:24:02.880 align:left position:22%
Then my grandfather said:
"There is a piece of land here, build here."

00:24:05.320 --> 00:24:11.560 align:left position:22%
That is the universe
we find ourselves in today.

<c.teletext>Yrjö Kukkapuro had

00:24:18.640 --> 00:24:24.320 align:left position:22%
<c.teletext>–and experimented like an inventor

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:33.600 align:left position:22%
He bought a flexible metal mesh
that he shaped after his body.

00:24:33.760 --> 00:24:37.960 align:left position:22%
Then he poured plaster over the chicken wire.

455389cf-9bd5-4d08-9fe6-01f6ecd2e99e
00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:45.760 align:left position:22%
He used sculptor's tools
when creating the Carousel chair.

00:24:47.440 --> 00:24:51.600 align:left position:22%
It must have felt overwhelming
for him–

12878670-f13b-4685-b6ae-6f3557c5dbea
00:24:51.760 --> 00:24:58.120 align:left position:22%
–to see the finished three-dimensional
form of his inner eye.

00:24:59.600 --> 00:25:05.640 align:left position:22%
Today, one can easily create similar things
with the help of a 3D printer–

00:25:05.800 --> 00:25:10.400 align:left position:22%
–but Yrjö succeeded in creating
his own 3D experience.

00:26:41.520 --> 00:26:48.400 align:left position:22%
The idea for the Thunderball came from the Åbo shipyard,
where I had been many times.

00:26:48.560 --> 00:26:51.960 align:left position:22%
There they built boats from fiberglass.

00:26:54.680 --> 00:27:00.320 align:left position:22%
I became fascinated with that material
and wanted to use it in some products.

00:27:11.800 --> 00:27:15.920 align:left position:22%
Here is the original Thunderball–

00:27:20.040 --> 00:27:23.920 align:left position:22%
It already looks like the original drawing.

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:37.040 align:left position:22%
In the beginning, the idea was a kind of cube.

00:27:37.200 --> 00:27:42.080 align:left position:22%
But that just looked dumb
with legs on a cube.

00:27:42.240 --> 00:27:46.240 align:left position:22%
I dropped that
and got the idea of a ball.

00:27:47.640 --> 00:27:52.280 align:left position:22%
It should be big enough
to accommodate one person.

00:27:53.520 --> 00:27:58.600 align:left position:22%
The next step for me was
to get a telephone in the chair.

00:28:01.200 --> 00:28:05.640 align:left position:22%
I called LM Ericsson

00:28:05.800 --> 00:28:12.520 align:left position:22%
–and asked if I could buy a red
telephone that often sat on the kitchen wall.

You put your finger in a dial

It still works.
